    <p>Prometheus is a 2012 British-American science fiction film directed by Ridley Scott and starring Noomi Rapace,
        Michael Fassbender, Guy Pearce, Idris Elba, Logan Marshall-Green and Charlize Theron. Written by Jon Spaihts and
        Damon Lindelof, the story takes place in the late 21st century and centers on the crew of the spaceship
        Prometheus as they follow a star map discovered among the remnants of several ancient Earth cultures. Led to a
        distant world and an advanced civilization, the crew seeks the origins of humanity but instead discovers a
        threat that could cause the extinction of the human race.
        The film began development in the early 2000s as a fifth entry in the Alien franchise, with both Scott and
        director James Cameron developing ideas for a film that would serve as a prequel to Scott's 1979 science fiction
        horror film Alien. By 2003, the project was sidelined by the development of Alien vs. Predator, and remained
        dormant until 2009 when Scott again showed interest. A script by Spaihts acted as a prequel to the events of the
        Alien films, but Scott opted for a different direction to avoid repeating cues from those films. In late 2010,
        he brought Lindelof onto the project to rewrite Spaihts' script, and together they developed a separate story
        that precedes the story of Alien but is not directly connected to that franchise. According to Scott, though the
        film shares "strands of Alien's DNA, so to speak", and takes place in the same universe, Prometheus explores its
        own mythology and ideas.

        The film entered production in April 2010, with extensive design phases developing the technology and creatures
        the film required. Principal photography began in March 2011 at Shepperton Studios and Pinewood Studios, on an
        estimated $120â€“130 million budget. Filming took place almost entirely on practical sets and on location in
        England, Iceland, Spain and Scotland. The film was shot using 3D cameras.

        Prometheus was supported by an extensive marketing campaign that included viral activities on the web. As part
        of this campaign, several original short films were produced featuring stars from the film playing their
        characters, expanding on elements of the fictional universe. These videos received a generally a positive
        reception. Prometheus was released on June 1, 2012 in the United Kingdom and was released on June 8, 2012 in
        North America. The film was followed by a sequel, Alien: Covenant (2017)./p>
